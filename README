Features (! means new in 2.0)
=============================

- sync library attachment to any php enabled webhosting space (including freely available ones) through a php based WebDAV implementation. This means that you attachment data never has to be stored on computers (clients and servers) that you do not control yourself.
- ! access your zotero library on your own webspace through the zotero.org server API, including sorting, detail view, custom number of items per page etc
- ! view your synced attachments on your own webspace from any web browser without having to use zotero.org’s own storage server
- ! unlike zotero.org’s own attachment viewing feature, phpZoteroWebDAV allows you to view web snapshots as well
